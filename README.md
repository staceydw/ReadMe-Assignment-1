# ReadMe-Assignment-1
For the Module 1 Challenge, I had help from two tutors (Angel and Xolani) with the Goal Analysis, using COUNTIFS to count the number of campaigns for each outcome. 
Additionally, I asked the AI Xpert in the Bootcamp Spot some questions as I went along, such as the reminder of the difference between VAR.S and VAR.P. I asked this regarding the last part of the assignment where the directions ask us to find the variance of the successful and failed campaigns.
Some of the questions I asked the AI Xpert did not result in correct formulas since I was not originally asking the question correctly. For example, I was attempting to use IFS when I should have been using the sort and filter option.
